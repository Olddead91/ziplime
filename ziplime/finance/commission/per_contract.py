    Calculates a commission for a transaction based on a per contract cost with

    Parameters
    ----------
    cost : float or dict
        The amount of commissions paid per contract traded. If given a float,
        the commission for all futures contracts is the same. If given a
        dictionary, it must map root symbols to the commission cost for
        contracts of that symbol.
    exchange_fee : float or dict
        A flat-rate fee charged by the exchange per trade. This value is a
        constant, one-time charge no matter how many contracts are being
        traded. If given a float, the fee for all contracts is the same. If
        given a dictionary, it must map root symbols to the fee for contracts
        of that symbol.
    min_trade_cost : float, optional
        The minimum amount of commissions paid per trade.
