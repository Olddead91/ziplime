        Calculate the amount of commission to charge on ``order`` as a result

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : ziplime.finance.order.Order
            The order being processed.

            The ``commission`` field of ``order`` is a float indicating the
            amount of commission already charged on this order.

        transaction : ziplime.finance.transaction.Transaction
            The transaction being processed. A single order may generate
            multiple transactions if there isn't enough volume in a given bar

        -------
        amount_charged : float
            The additional commission, in dollars, that we should attribute to
            this order.
